Sweat running all over my chest I don't quit no<br>
I just press harder, yea, than I ever did before going for<br>
The dreams that I have in store in my mind and I know<br>
That I'm makin it I gotta get mine and nobody's takin' it away<br>
No, 'cause Hammer don't play that you try to get mine<br>
</p>
<p>
Boy, you better step back freeze 'cause you don't want none<br>
I hustle for my muscle and you look weak son, real weak<br>
Yea, I'm goin' for all that I can get<br>
Kickin' at the top 'cause I'm too legit to quit sing<br>

A get you back and I'll hit with a dose of Oak Town power<br>
And charge you by the hour I'm shakin' like a quake and funks<br>
Get devoured I choose to abuse, misuse and confuse<br>
Competitors who think they're makin' up all the rules, fools<br>
</p>
<p>
In the game lame and insane it's a shame I gotta do this<br>
But I remain the same unchanged gettin' better never known<br>
As a sweater kickin' it at the top 'cause I got myself together<br>
So roll with a guy who's physical and fit knows the time<br>
And too legit to quit, sang<br>
